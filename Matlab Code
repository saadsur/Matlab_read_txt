id = [1,2,3,5,6,9,12,15] %this vector is from the txt sequence 
%here you can make you for loop and change the id(x) variable with loop
dat = id(1)
P_data= load('0_subject\' + string(dat)+ {'_1.txt'}); % read comma separated data this is important because my file names are 2_1.txt, 3_1.txt and so on
plot(P_data)
%you can create 2D vector to store all values in a vector
